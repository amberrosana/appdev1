## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because they are necessary for my course. These tools can help me store my projects, track the changes, recover the previous versions if I make mistakes, etc. They are essential for my future career. Additionally, I can also use GitHub as a platform to share my work and collaborate with other professionals and broaden my network.
