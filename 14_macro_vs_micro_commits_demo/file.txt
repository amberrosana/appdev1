Realization: What did you notice about the commit history after switching from macro to micro commits?

With the macro commit, all the unrelated changes I did were in a single commit. There's only a single commit added in the history.
However, this is bad practice as it can cause confusion and make it harder to understand the projectâ€™s history, track down bugs, or revert specific changes.

I then used git reset --hard HEAD~1 to delete the macro commit from the commit history and also delete the changes it made from my working directory.

With the micro commits, I committed the unrelated changes one by one. There are 3 commits added in the commit history.
This is good practice as the specific changes made can be easily understood.
