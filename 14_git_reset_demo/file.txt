Realization: What did you notice about the file and commit history after reset?

I used git reset --hard with the "Add line 2" commit.
When I checked the history with git log, the commit after "Add Line 2" (which is "Add Line 3") was gone.

The "Line 3" text in file.txt was also gone. 

It removed the commits after "Add line 2" and also removed the changes from my working directory.
I realized that git reset --hard <commit-hash> erases all commits made after the specified commit, removes their changes from my working directory, and deletes them from the commit history in git log.
